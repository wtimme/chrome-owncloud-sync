====================

Chrome extension to sync bookmarks with ownCloud server.

Important: This is **heavily work-in-progress** and should not, by any means,
be considered stable. I am just trying to figure a way to sync Chrome
with my ownCloud server. Please feel free to contribute or follow the discussion
in the official ownCloud issue tracker here on GitHub.

Thanks to the guys from http://extensionizr.com/ for taking care of all Chrome
extension related boilerplate code!
