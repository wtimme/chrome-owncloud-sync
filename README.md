chrome-owncloud-sync
====================

Chrome extension to sync bookmarks with ownCloud server.

Important: This is **heavily work-in-progress** and should not, by any means,
be considered stable. I am just trying to figure a way to sync Chrome
with my ownCloud server. Please feel free to contribute or follow the discussion
in the official ownCloud issue tracker here on GitHub.
